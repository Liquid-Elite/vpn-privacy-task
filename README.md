## Step-by-Step Task Breakdown

### 1. Choose a VPN Service and Sign Up
- Selected ProtonVPN for this task due to its reputation and free tier availability.
- Created an account using a valid email address.

### 2. Download and Install VPN Client
- Downloaded the ProtonVPN application compatible with Windows OS.
- Completed the installation following the on-screen instructions.

### 3. Connect to a VPN Server
- Opened the ProtonVPN client and logged in.
- Connected to the nearest available VPN server for better speed and reliability.

### 4. Verify IP Address Change
- Visited [whatismyipaddress.com](https://www.whatismyipaddress.com) before and after connecting to the VPN.
- Confirmed that the IP address and approximate location changed to the VPN server’s location.

### 5. Test Encrypted Browsing
- Browsed HTTPS websites to ensure secure traffic.
- Observed that the VPN encrypted internet traffic, preventing monitoring or interception.

### 6. Disconnect and Compare
- Disconnected the VPN client.
- Noted the original IP address and compared browsing speeds with and without the VPN.

## Research & Findings on VPN Encryption and Privacy Features

- **Encryption:** VPNs use strong encryption algorithms like AES-256 and ChaCha20 to convert data into unreadable formats during transmission. Only authorized parties with the decryption keys can access this data.

- **Tunneling Protocols:** Common protocols include OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2/IPSec, and L2TP/IPSec. These protocols create secure “tunnels” between your device and VPN servers.

- **Privacy Enhancements:** Features such as kill switches prevent data leaks if the VPN connection drops. DNS leak protection ensures DNS queries also go through the VPN, preserving anonymity.

- **No-Log Policies:** Trusted VPN providers do not log users’ activities to prevent tracking or data breaches.

## Benefits of Using VPN

- Protects online privacy by encrypting internet traffic.
- Masks IP address to hide physical location.
- Secures public Wi-Fi connections against hackers.
- Bypasses geo-restrictions for streaming or browsing.
- Prevents ISP throttling of bandwidth.
- Enables secure remote access for businesses and individuals.

---

## Limitations and Considerations

- VPN can reduce internet speed due to encryption overhead.
- Not all VPN providers respect privacy; some may log user data.
- Some services actively block VPN connections.
- VPN does not guarantee total anonymity; other tracking methods still apply.
- Legal restrictions on VPN usage exist in some countries.

## Summary

VPNs play a critical role in securing online communications and protecting user privacy. While they provide encryption and IP masking, users must select trustworthy providers and understand VPN limitations. This task helped build hands-on experience with VPN setup and deepened knowledge about encryption technologies and privacy features essential in cybersecurity.
