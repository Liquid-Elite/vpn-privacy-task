VPN Summary: Benefits and Limitations

✅ Benefits of VPN:
1. Encrypts your internet traffic, making it unreadable to hackers and ISPs.
2. Hides your IP address and location by routing traffic through a secure server.
3. Allows safe browsing on public Wi-Fi networks.
4. Bypasses geo-restrictions to access region-locked content (e.g., Netflix, websites).
5. Helps avoid bandwidth throttling by ISPs.
6. Enables secure remote access for businesses and individuals.
7. Enforces privacy with features like kill switch and DNS leak protection.

⚠️ Limitations of VPN:
1. May reduce internet speed due to encryption overhead.
2. Not all VPNs are trustworthy — free or unknown providers may log your data.
3. Some websites or services block VPN usage (e.g., banking apps, streaming platforms).
4. VPNs do not make you completely anonymous; tracking is still possible through cookies or accounts.
5. VPN effectiveness depends on the quality of the provider and configuration.
6. Legal restrictions may apply in certain countries where VPN use is regulated or banned.
