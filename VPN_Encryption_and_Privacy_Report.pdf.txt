VPN Encryption and Privacy Features

1. What is a VPN?
A VPN (Virtual Private Network) hides your internet activity. It creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and a VPN server, keeping your online actions private and safe from hackers or ISPs.

2. How Does a VPN Protect You?
When you use a VPN, your data is encrypted and sent through a secure tunnel to a server. Even your ISP cannot see what you’re doing. It ensures privacy and security on any network.

3. What is Encryption?
Encryption turns your information into unreadable code. VPNs use strong encryption like AES-256 (used by governments) and ChaCha20 (faster on phones) to protect your data.

4. What is a Tunneling Protocol?
Tunneling protocols decide how data travels securely. Examples:
- OpenVPN: Strong and safe
- WireGuard: Modern and fast
- IKEv2: Great for mobile use

5. Comparing VPN Protocols:
- OpenVPN: Secure, slower
- WireGuard: Fast, modern
- IKEv2: Best for mobile stability

6. Real-Life Use Cases:
1. Public Wi-Fi: Protects you from hackers in coffee shops
2. Geo-Blocking: Lets you access content like US Netflix
3. Remote Work: Secure access to company networks from home

7. Privacy Features:
- No-logs policy: VPN doesn't track you
- Kill switch: Cuts internet if VPN fails
- DNS leak protection: Hides which sites you visit
- Split tunneling: Choose which apps use VPN

8. Limitations:
- VPNs can slow your speed
- Some sites block VPNs
- VPNs are not 100% anonymous
- Trusting the VPN provider is important

9. Summary:
VPNs help protect your privacy, encrypt your traffic, and hide your online activity. They are great tools for privacy, security, and access — but they're not foolproof.
